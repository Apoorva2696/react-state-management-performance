# React Performance with state management and memoization

This is a basic react Blogging app with the ability to write new, edit and delete exisiting blogs.

The component heirarchy is,

The above diagram depicts the children of Blog Page and how each child should be agnostic to changes in the parent which are not related to it.
If the parent state change does not effect a component then it should no re-render.

To improve performance we need to reduce the unecessary re-renders of components. We achieve this by using-

1. `React.memo()`, useMemo, useCallback - for memoization
2.  Using Context with `children` as props to avoid unnecessary re-renders of child components. The structure used to define the context is mentioned [here](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively).

With these we can reduce the re-renders and thus improving load time for the overall application when user interacts with it.

# Playground

Use this app as playground to test how using different hooks you can improve perfomance of your app. You can also see in the Profiler devtool how the app is caching components and preventing their re-render.


# Get Started

To test the app:

1. Create a clone and run the command npm i
2. Run the command `npm run dev`
